            <h1>SCRML Home</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the home site of SCRML! SCRML (Self-Contained Resources Markup Language) is a markup language designed for abstract mathematics. This site will house all SCRML documentation and will host a SCRML editor so you the user can easily read, write, and compile SCRML files. There will also be a few pages devoted to introducing abstract mathematics to the general population and decribing the motivation behind SCRML as well as some potential applications.</p>
            <p>This site is still very much under construction. For now, the links below will serve as the access points.</p>
            <p><a href="GRML/graphs.pdf">Link</a> to a pdf introduction of GRML, the theory behind SCRML.</p>
            <p><a href="content/editor.html">Link</a> to an in-browser SCRML editor.</p>
